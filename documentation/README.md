# Hair By Yehudit

This project is the backend for managing appointments for a hair salon. Given time constraints, I have currently created a MVP. This project allows a client manage customers availability and appointments and it allows customers to sign up, verify themselves and make and view appointments. The current API allows for easy extension and integration with a more developed final product.

The backend is built using express package for Node.js and MySQL DB for data management.
